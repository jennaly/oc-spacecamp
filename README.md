# Orange County Space Camp
An application that shows the user NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) and a short description on the image. Users can also select any day in the past. For certain days, the server may return a video.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The imagery, title, and description are fetched from <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/">NASA's APOD API</a>. Input from the user is appended to the request URL as a parameter to retrieve data from the specified date. The website layout is built to be responsive using flexbox.

## Optimizations

I refactored a complicated function that had multiple components to it: fetching the data, removing and creating elements, and appending said elements to the DOM. The refactored code now consists of smaller individual functions that each serve a single purpose and are aptly named after their sole intention. This results in cleaner, more structured logic as well as easier debugging. The enter key is binded to the submit button for enhanced user experience.

**Edge Case:** If the end user selects a date in the future, a randomly chosen fun fact and accompanying image will be returned in place of blank results. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned to implement DOM manipulation methods from the need to update contents of the HTML document with the data returned by the NASA API.
